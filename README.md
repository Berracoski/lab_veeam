# lab_veeam

This repository contains resources, scripts, or configurations related to setting up and managing a Veeam backup lab environment, including Virtual Labs for verification and recovery testing.

## Overview

Veeam Virtual Labs provide an isolated virtual environment that mirrors your production network to verify backup recoverability, run application tests, and perform staged restores without impacting the production environment. This lab emulates production-like conditions securely and allows automated backup verifications (SureBackup), On-Demand Sandbox testing, and more.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up and using the lab environment based on Veeam Backup & Replication products.

### Prerequisites

- VMware vSphere environment (ESXi hosts or vCenter)
- Veeam Backup & Replication installed and configured
- Access to a datastore and hosts for lab deployment
- Network permissions to create isolated virtual networks

### Installation

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Berracoski/lab_veeam.git
cd lab_veeam
```

Review the scripts and configuration files included to deploy Virtual Labs, proxy appliances, and application groups as part of your SureBackup or recovery verification setup.

### Usage

- Use the provided scripts/configs to create or manage Veeam Virtual Labs.
- Run backup verification jobs leveraging the isolated lab environment.
- Simulate recovery and failover scenarios safely without disrupting production workloads.
- Customize network isolation and IP mappings according to your environment.

Refer to official Veeam documentation and your local setup for detailed steps on deploying and configuring virtual labs, networking, and proxy appliances.
